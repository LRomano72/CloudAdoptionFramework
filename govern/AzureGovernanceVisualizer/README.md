```

Do you want to get granular insights on your technical Azure Governance implementation? - document it in CSV, HTML, Markdown and JSON?  
AzGovViz is a PowerShell based script that iterates your Azure Tenant´s Management Group hierarchy down to Subscription level. It captures most relevant Azure governance capabilities such as Azure Policy, RBAC and Blueprints and a lot more. From the collected data AzGovViz provides visibility on your __HierarchyMap__, creates a __TenantSummary__, creates __DefinitionInsights__ and builds granular __ScopeInsights__ on Management Groups and Subscriptions. The technical requirements as well as the required permissions are minimal.

You can run the script either for your Tenant Root Group or any other Management Group.

## Mission

"_Governance can be a complex thing_.."

Challenges:

 * Holistic overview on governance implementation  
 * Connecting the dots

AzGovViz is intended to help you to get a holistic overview on your technical Azure Governance implementation by __connecting the dots__

  * [Install the Azure Az PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)
* Usage/command
  * `.\AzGovVizParallel.ps1 -ManagementGroupId <your-Management-Group-Id>`

### Parameters
  * `-ManagementGroupId` Management Group Id (Root Management Group Id equals your Tenant Id)
  * `-CsvDelimiter` - The world is split into two kinds of delimiters - comma and semicolon - choose yours (default is semicolon ';')
  * `-OutputPath` 
  * ~~`-AzureDevOpsWikiAsCode` - Use this parameter only when running AzGovViz in a Azure DevOps Pipeline~~ Based on environment variables the script will detect the code run platform
  * `-DoNotShowRoleAssignmentsUserData` - Scrub personally identifiable information (PII)
  * `-LimitCriticalPercentage` - Limit warning level, default is 80%
  * ~~`-HierarchyTreeOnly`~~ `-HierarchyMapOnly` - Output only the __HierarchyMap__ for Management Groups including linked Subscriptions
  * `-SubscriptionQuotaIdWhitelist` - Process only Subscriptions with defined QuotaId(s). Example: .\AzGovVizParallel.ps1 `-SubscriptionQuotaIdWhitelist MSDN_,Enterprise_`
  * `-NoResourceProvidersDetailed` - Disables output for ResourceProvider states for all Subscriptions in the __TenantSummary__ section, in large Tenants this can become time consuming
  * `-NoMDfCSecureScore` - Disables Microsoft Defender for Cloud Secure Score request for Subscriptions and Management Groups.
  * ~~`-DisablePolicyComplianceStates`~~ `-NoPolicyComplianceStates` - Will not query policy compliance states. You may want to use this parameter to accellerate script execution or when receiving error 'ResponseTooLarge'. 
  * `-NoResourceDiagnosticsPolicyLifecycle` - Disables Resource Diagnostics Policy Lifecycle recommendations
  * `-NoAADGroupsResolveMembers` - Disables resolving Azure Active Directory Group memberships
  * ~~`-NoAADGuestUsers` - Disables resolving Azure Active Directory User type (Guest or Member)~~
  * ~~`-NoServicePrincipalResolve` `-NoAADServicePrincipalResolve` - Disables resolving ServicePrincipals~~
  * ~~`-ServicePrincipalExpiryWarningDays`~~ `-AADServicePrincipalExpiryWarningDays` - Define warning period for Service Principal secret and certificate expiry; default is 14 days
  * ~~`-NoAzureConsumption`~~ - Azure Consumption data should not be collected/reported
  * `-DoAzureConsumption` - Azure Consumption data should be collected/reported
  * `-AzureConsumptionPeriod` - Define for which time period Azure Consumption data should be gathered; default is 1 day
  * `-NoAzureConsumptionReportExportToCSV` - Azure Consumption data should not be exported (CSV)
  * `-NoScopeInsights` - Q: Why would you want to do this? A: In larger tenants the ScopeInsights section blows up the html file (up to unusable due to html file size). Use `-LargeTenant` to further reduce the output.
  * `-ThrottleLimit` - leveraging PowerShell´s parallel capability you can define the ThrottleLimit (default=5)
  * `-DoTranscript` - Log the console output
  * `-SubscriptionId4AzContext` - Define the Subscription Id to use for AzContext (default is to use a random Subscription Id)
  * `-PolicyAtScopeOnly` - Removing 'inherited' lines in the HTML file for 'Policy Assignments'; use this parameter if you run against a larger tenants. Note using parameter `-LargeTenant` will set `-PolicyAtScopeOnly $true`
  * `-RBACAtScopeOnly` - Removing 'inherited' lines in the HTML file for 'Role Assignments'; use this parameter if you run against a larger tenants. Note using parameter `-LargeTenant` will set `-RBACAtScopeOnly $true`
  * ~~`-CsvExport`~~ `-NoCsvExport` - Do not export enriched data for 'Role assignments', 'Policy assignments' data and 'all Resources' (subscriptionId,  managementGroup path, resourceType, id, name, location, tags, createdTime, changedTime)
  * ~~`-PolicyIncludeResourceGroups`~~ `-DoNotIncludeResourceGroupsOnPolicy` - Do not include Policy assignments on ResourceGroups
  * ~~`-RBACIncludeResourceGroupsAndResources`~~ `-DoNotIncludeResourceGroupsAndResourcesOnRBAC` - Do not include Role assignments on ResourceGroups and Resources

  * `-JsonExportExcludeResourceGroups` - JSON Export will not include ResourceGroups (Policy & Role assignments)
  * `-JsonExportExcludeResources`- JSON Export will not include Resources (Role assignments)
  * `-LargeTenant` - A large tenant is a tenant with more than ~500 Subscriptions - the HTML output for large tenants simply becomes too big. Using this parameter the following parameters will be set: -PolicyAtScopeOnly $true, -RBACAtScopeOnly $true, -NoResourceProvidersDetailed $true, -NoScopeInsights $true
  * `-HtmlTableRowsLimit` - Although the parameter `-LargeTenant` was introduced recently, still the html output may become too large to be processed properly. The new parameter defines the limit of rows - if for the html processing part the limit is reached then the html table will not be created (csv and json output will still be created). Default rows limit is 20.000
  * `-AADGroupMembersLimit` - Defines the limit (default=500) of AAD Group members; For AAD Groups that have more members than the defined limit Group members will not be resolved

## Integrate with AzOps

Did you know you can run AzOps from Azure DevOps? Check [AzOps Accellerator](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps-Accelerator).  
You can integrate AzGovViz (same project as AzOps).

```yaml
  pipelines:
    - pipeline: 'Push'
      source: 'AzOps - Push'
      trigger:
        branches:
          include:
            - master
```

## Stats

In order to better understand the AzGovViz usage and to optimize the product accordingly some stats will be ingested to Azure Application Insights. Results of stats analysis may be shared at a later stage. 

### How/What?

If the script is run in Azure DevOps then the Repository Id and executing principal´s object Id will be used to create an unique identifier.  
If the script is not run in Azure DevOps then the Tenant Id and executing principal´s object Id will be used to create an unique identifier.

SHA384/512 hashed combination of 
* portion of the repositoryId/tenantId 
  * if repositoryId/tenantId startsWith a letter then use characters 3-8 (6 characters) of the first GUID´s block, combine them with the third GUID`s block of the principal´s objectId (4 characters), SHA512 hash them as identifier0
  * if repositoryId/tenantId startsWith a number then use characters 7-12 (6 characters) of the last GUID`s block, combine them with the second GUID´s block of the principal´s objectId (4 characters), SHA384 hash them as identifier0
* portion of the executing principal´s objectId 
  * if objectId startsWith a letter then use characters 3-8 (6 characters) of the first GUID´ block, combine them with the third GUID´ block of the repositoryId/tenantId (4 characters), SHA512 hash them as identifier1
  * if objectId startsWith a number then use characters 7-12 (6 characters) of the last GUID´ block, combine them with the second GUID´ block of the repositoryId/tenantId (4 characters), SHA384 hash them as identifier1

Combine identifier0 and identifier1
  * if objectId startsWith a letter then combine identifiers -> 'identifier0 + identifier1', SHA512 hash them as final identifier and remove dashes (string of 128 characters)
  * if objectId startsWith a number then combine identifiers -> 'identifier1 + identifier0', SHA512 hash them as final identifier and remove dashes (string of 128 characters)

To conclude the approach: taking 6 or 4 characters from tenantId/respositoryId and objectId of the executing principal to create a unique identifier, which may not be backward resolveable.

The following data will be ingested to Azure Application Insights:

```
    "accType": "ServicePrincipal / User (member) / User (Guest)",
    "azCloud": "Azure environment e.g. AzureCloud, ChinaCloud, etc.",
    "identifier": "8c62a7..53d08c0 (string of 128 characters)",
    "platform": "Console / AzureDevOps",
    "productVersion": "used AzGovViz version",
    "psAzAccountsVersion": "used Az.Accounts PS module version",
    "psVersion": "used PowerShell version",
    "scopeUsage": "childManagementGroup / rootManagementGroup",
    "statsCountErrors": "count of encountered errors",
    "statsCountSubscriptions": "less than 100 / more than 100 (no exact numbers)",

Thank you for your support!

## Security

AzGovViz creates very detailed information about your Azure Governance setup. In your organization's best interest the __outputs should be protected from not authorized access!__

## Known issues

Working with Git and Windows cloning from your AzDO repository you may experience the following error:

```
fatal: cannot create directory at 'output/JSON_...': Filename too long
```

To work around that issue you may want to enable longpaths support.  
__Note the [caveats](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/8023)!__

```
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

## Facts

Disabled Subscriptions and Subscriptions where Quota Id starts with with "AAD_" are being skipped, all others are queried. More information on Subscription Quota Id / Offer numbers: [Supported Microsoft Azure offers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-cost-mgt-data#supported-microsoft-azure-offers).  

ARM Limits are not acquired programmatically, these are hardcoded. The links used to check related limits are commented in the param section of the script.
